# 🎬 Betsson Movies App
A full-stack movie browsing application built with Next.js, Express, MongoDB, and Docker.



## 🚀 Getting Started
Build the app with Docker

### Start Containers
```docker compose up -d --build```

```-d``` Run in detached mode (background).

```--build```  Rebuild images before starting (ensures code changes are applied).

### Stop Containers
```docker compose down -v```

```-v``` Removes named volumes (wipes the MongoDB data for a clean slate).

### View Logs
```docker compose logs -f [service_name]```

```-f``` Stream/follow the logs in real-time.

- *Example: ```docker compose logs -f backend```*



## 🛠 Database & Backend

### Seed Database
The database seeds automatically on startup, but you can manually trigger it:

```docker compose exec backend npm run seed```

### Swagger Documentation
Explore the API endpoints and schemas: 🔗 http://localhost:5000/api/docs



## 🧪 Testing
These tests verify the full integration from the UI to the Database. Ensure the containers are running before starting.

### Frontend Tests (Playwright)
Run tests with the UI Dashboard (Recommended for debugging)

```cd .\frontend\``` and ```npm run test```

### Backend Tests (Jest + Supertest)

```docker compose exec backend npm run test```



## 🏗️ Architectural Decisions
### Why SSR (Server-Side Rendering)?
For this project, I transitioned the data-fetching logic from Client-Side (CSR) to Server-Side Rendering (SSR) using Next.js. This choice was driven by three main factors:

- Security & Internal Networking: By using SSR, the application communicates with the backend via the internal Docker network (http://backend:5000). This allows us to keep the backend and database private, exposing only the necessary ports to the user's browser.
- Performance (Reduced Latency): Server-to-server communication within a Docker network is significantly faster than a client’s browser making multiple requests over the public internet. This results in faster initial page loads and better Core Web Vitals.
- SEO & Metadata: SSR allows us to generate dynamic metadata (like movie titles and descriptions) on the server. This ensures that social media crawlers and search engines can accurately index each movie page.

### Dockerized Environment
The project is fully containerized to ensure "it works on my machine" translates to "it works on every machine."

- Isolation: The database, backend, and frontend run in isolated environments with specific dependencies.
- Volume Persistence: MongoDB data is stored in a named volume (mongo-data), ensuring that movie data persists even if the containers are stopped or removed.
- Hot Reloading: During development, I utilized Docker volumes to enable hot-reloading for both the frontend and backend, allowing for a seamless developer experience without constant container rebuilds.



## 📈 Handling Large Datasets
As the movie database grows, performance becomes a challenge. I have architected the system to handle data scaling through the following strategies:

- Efficient Querying with MongoDB Indexes: To prevent "Full Collection Scans" (which slow down as data grows), I implemented a unique index on the key field. This ensures that retrieving a specific movie’s details remains instantaneous ($O(1)$ complexity) regardless of whether there are 100 or 1,000,000 records.
- Server-Side Filtering: Instead of fetching all movies and filtering them in the browser (which would crash the user's device with large datasets), all filtering logic—including the multi-genre "AND" logic—is performed at the database level. This ensures the frontend only receives the exact data it needs to display.
- Memory Management via SSR: By using Server-Side Rendering, we shift the data-processing burden away from the user's browser. The server handles the heavy lifting of parsing large JSON objects, sending only the final HTML/CSS to the client, which is essential for low-powered mobile devices.



## 🔧 Refinements
Why not fetch-all and filter-locally? While fetching all data once is simpler for small datasets, I chose Backend Filtering to ensure the application remains performant at scale. This avoids sending massive JSON payloads to the client, reduces browser memory usage, and leverages MongoDB's indexing for near-instant results. This architecture follows the "Thin Client" principle, where the heavy computational lifting is handled by the server.

### Scalability & Future Roadmap
The current architecture is specifically designed to handle data growth through standard RESTful patterns. While the current dataset is manageable, the following features could be implmented into the backend logic:

- Pagination (Limit & Offset): The API supports limit and page parameters. This allows the application to scale to thousands of records without impacting frontend performance, supporting either a classic pagination UI or an "Infinite Scroll" experience.
- Result Sorting: The data layer is prepared to handle sorting parameters (e.g., sort=rating or sort=year), allowing users to reorder search results without additional client-side processing.
- Advanced Indexing: As the collection grows, MongoDB indexes can be expanded beyond the key field to include name (text indexing) and genres to keep query times near-instant.
- API Versioning: The backend is structured to support versioned routes (e.g., /api/v1/movies), ensuring that future updates to the data structure won't break existing frontend deployments.
